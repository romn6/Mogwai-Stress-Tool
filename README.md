# Mogwai-Stress-Tool

Welcome to the Mogwai Stress Tool. This tool is currently under development as part of my Computer Science senior project. It serves as a backup to a different repository that contains the same project but employs a different approach. The primary objective is to develop a stress tool designed to test the resilience of operating systems. The project aims to target various components such as CPU, RAM, memory, and more as it progresses.

## Documentation

The inspiration for this project derives from the development of a stress-testing tool similar to Gremlin, with an emphasis on addressing the stress itself. Our approach will concentrate on how we apply stress to the operating system, considering various components in the process. We aim to create a unique stress tool that draws inspiration from established tools like Gremlin and Stress-ng.

## Development

The following items are part of the project development and are currently being utilized:

- C Programming Language
- Virtual Machines
- Windows OS & Linux.

## Used By

This project is intended for a variety of users such as those with servers, data servers, home-labs, dev ops, and testing environment.

## Running Tests

To run tests, run the following commands:

First clone the repo by:
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/romn6/Mogwai-Stress-Tool.git
```
To compile:
```bash
    gcc stress.c -o stress
```
To run:
```Bash
./stress.c
```
This will possibly change with development, so keep mind that a pull might be needed later on.
